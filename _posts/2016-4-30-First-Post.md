I'm going to be using this blog as a journal of my internship, which will include a few notes every day, major events, and what I would like to accomplish. The first week has now past (frequency should be daily...). Here is what I wrote on Monday:  

> My lead was wearing a t-shirt. The boss wouldn't even admit he was the boss. We were up and running.

I guess the excitement caused me to skip some details. Macbooks are used to develop, and I am stoked about that! This internship differs from my last one in that the tools are all brand new. The last internship I did (Software development at the JSMB, Temple Portfolio) was where they used Java, JSPs, and JQuery, which I thought was new. But here everything is very new, like web components, EcmaScript 6, and Heroku. It's good to see both sides.
