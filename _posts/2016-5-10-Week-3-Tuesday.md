title: Week 3 - Tuesday

I learned the application of "ask and ye shall receive" in the work area. My co-intern and I asked some co-workers if we should work on their project since we were done with our task. They discouraged us due to the complexity. After being bored of tutorials, we asked one of the leads who said 'sure!'. Now I feel a little overwhelmed, but it will help me learn!
