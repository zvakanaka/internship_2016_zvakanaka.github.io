title: Week 5 - Tuesday

[customelements.io](https://customelements.io) was shared in Google IO in the [Web Components Presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFF2Yup2dMM). Although W3 standards began in 2012 for web components, they are just beginning to emerge. I was told to get familiar with them before I started this internship, and that was the first I had heard of them. In the presentation, the speaker frequently pointed out that JavaScript frameworks have become "mega frameworks", and that web components are the antidote. These frameworks have caused much grief to both developers and users. The developers have to constantly maintain their apps through constant framework updates, they often have to switch frameworks entirely, and users are required to wait while their browser downloads a massive library of code before execution even begins. Everything needed to load a component is built into a modern browser.
