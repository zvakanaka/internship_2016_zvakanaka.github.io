title: Week 5 - Wednesday

The whole [web components talk](https://customelements.io) started a conversation. The presentation's hooks were that web components would solve the web's two growing problems: users with slow connections are suffering from mega frameworks, and users with old devices are suffering from mega frameworks. But as the talk goes on, it's evident that web components leave these issues unsolved. Not only does an unsupported browser have to download a polyfill to get web components working, but the browser itself may not even support the downloaded JavaScript ([Opera Mini World Usage Statistics](http://gs.statcounter.com/#all-browser-ww-monthly-201506-201506-map)).  

> If you’re using the “wrong” browser—like, say, Opera Mini—you get nothing. That’s not progressive. That’s the opposite of progressive. The end result may feel very “app-like” if you’re using an approved browser, but throwing the users of other web browsers under the bus is the very antithesis of what makes the web great. What does it profit a website to gain app-like features if it loses its soul?  

> I hope we’ll see more examples of Progressive Web Apps that don’t require JavaScript to render content, and don’t throw away responsiveness in favour of a return to device-specific silos. But I’m not holding my breath. People seem to be so caught up in the attempt to get native-like functionality that they’re willing to give up the very things that make the web great. - [Jeremy Keith - Regressive Web Apps](https://adactio.com/journal/10708)
