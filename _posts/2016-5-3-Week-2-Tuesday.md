title: Week 2 - Tuesday
---
It's Tuesday of the second week already! I have been reading documentation, practicing JavaScript and Node tutorials from [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/), and attending meetings.  

Derrick and I received our first bit of work today. Logan gave us a pull request to review. GitHub is used here, which is much preferred by me. I was just getting familiar with the type of code he had us review, which was a bug that can be explained by the guide, [You Don't Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/ch2.md#truthy--falsy). It turns out that there are many constructs of the language that do not work the way most people think, but it has become popular to adopt the easier-to-understand nincompoop paradigms. Here's a [quote](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/ch3.md#chapter-3-into-ydkjs) from Kyle Simpson's [GitHub](https://github.com/getify):  
> JS developers seem to stand out from the crowd in the sense of typically not learning very much of the language. This is not a good thing, and it's not something we should continue to allow to be the norm.

My goal here is to become one who does understand.
