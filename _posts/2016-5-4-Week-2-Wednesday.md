The first dive into the code. It was confusing, and I never would have found the file unless someone showed me. Well, maybe that's not true, because I found out my text editor, [atom](https://atom.io), was not searching files hidden in the `.gitignore` by default. I did some reading on how JavaScript really works with the [`this`](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md) thing. It was confusing.  

Ng-conf was today. We watched it live, and half of it seemed to be about brain surgery, girl scout cookies, and news that Angular has been postponed.  

From watching that conference, I am seeing that the future of JS could potentially be unstable. I'm not sure if I want to rest my energy for obtaining new skills there.
