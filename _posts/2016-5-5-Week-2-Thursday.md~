While reading Eric Elliott's [The Two Pillars of JavaScript](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-ee6f3281e7f3#.i5he1mg5y), I came across this quote about the two pillars, being prototypal inheritance and functional programming:

> Both pillars are equally important, but I’m concerned that a large number of JavaScript programmers are completely missing one or both innovations, because JavaScript is pretty good at letting you code poorly if you don’t bother to learn it properly.

These things go along with my goal of actually learning JavaScript.

Totally unrelated, but I liked this quote from the article:
