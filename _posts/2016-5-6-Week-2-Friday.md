title: Week 2 - Friday

Jakob shared a video about the [origin of JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO1Wnu-xKoY). Ng-conf was still going on. I do not know Angular myself, so it was pretty boring, but I was able to learn how to reinstall npm after completely destroying it while trying to install an app to test with a new translation method. Monday will be a better day.
