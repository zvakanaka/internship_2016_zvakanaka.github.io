title: Week 3 - Monday
---
Monday was a better day. I am writing this Tuesday morning, because I forgot yesterday. I read the article, [9 Reasons JavaScript must die, and soon](http://patrickbay.ca/blog/?p=610), and I agree that they are all good points, but I do not side with them. I don't even know if the writer, Patrick Bay, agreed with his own points, but the exploration is what I like about the article.  

> Because JavaScript is an interpreted language, itâ€™s heavy... it's an absolute battery killer.  

The [link](http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/05/measuring-the-impact-of-web-page-structures-on-battery-usage-in-mobile-devices.html) given states that *poorly designed* sites drain battery. I do believe it's necessary to be careful not to use too much JavaScript, but any good site is optimized to have a much lighter mobile experience.  

The other big point made is security. Not only does JavaScript let programmers do all sorts of "naive" things, but browsers themselves are full of vulnerabilities (Bay shared [this link](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/news/2240242771/At-2015-Pwn2Own-competition-browser-exploits-in-the-spotlight) about Pwn2Own). This is the big point that I see in this article, but doesn't every language have its chinks? JavaScript can now be executed server-side with NodeJS. While malicious programmers may write code to write to any part of the file system (by finding a browser exploit), that is their code, and someone must first visit the sketchy website. I believe that when developers know what they are doing, 99% of the security problems of JavaScript disappear.  

The article made some excellent points revealing the problems of JavaScript, but JavaScript itself is ubiquitous across the web. It makes the web easier to use, and has grown faster than any language I know of. The internet would be so bland without it. I can't predict the future, but I think it's here to stay.
