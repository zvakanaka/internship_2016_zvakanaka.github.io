While figuring out how to set up a `.pac` proxy file, I found [productsthathateyou.com](http://www.productsthathateyou.com/), a great website for HCI.  

I have been looking into the security of private GitHub repositories. There is a famous [exploit](http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/GitHub-security-incident-highlights-Ruby-on-Rails-problem-1463207.html) that happened in 2012, as well as additional concerns on stackoverflow, although Github has a [security](https://help.github.com/articles/github-security/) article that claims to be robust.
