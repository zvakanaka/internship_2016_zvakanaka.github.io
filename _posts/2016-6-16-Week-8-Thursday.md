It looks like [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) now supports armv6 ([must install from source](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001808/ch01.html#chap5_id35940363)).

I'm thinking of doing a personal project with a [display](http://www.dx.com/p/5-0-led-display-screen-car-rear-view-stand-security-monitor-800-x-480-pixels-152008#.V2LZV-YrLyg) so I can see new things on Craigslist.  

Yesterday we learned about [observables](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-introducing-the-observable), which would be perfect for the display of the craigslist project, although I'll be using plain JS and an [interval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) instead.

Oh, and zsh npm completion was found [here](https://thesabbir.com/how-to-get-npm-tab-completion-for-zsh-and-bash/).
