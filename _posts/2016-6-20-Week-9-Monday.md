title: Week 9 - Monday
---
We did a lot of work today, but it was mostly in the story that was supposed to be finished last week. This is a case of 99% syndrome. Maybe it's because the easiest parts were done first, or maybe things just keep creeping up and revealing themselves.  

I had a dream last night that an angry man approached a house I was hiding in. He was known to be mean, which is why I was hiding. Then he came in and yelled at me that I need to study more and seek understanding in what I am doing (what I learned from [D&C 9](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/9) last night before going to bed). When he said that, I stopped hiding my face and agreed. When I awoke, I began working on a practice app in Node JS.
