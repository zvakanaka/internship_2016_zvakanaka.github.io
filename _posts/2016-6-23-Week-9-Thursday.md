Firebase experimentation. I left off on [this page](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web/#10).

Continued the story. It is amazing how many walls I run into about design decisions. My co-intern and I both worked on it at the same time, I wrote it by taking a piece of the project that already existed, and he wrote it from scratch while using the existing piece as an example. We both got it working. I realized once talking about it that I did not need all of the bloat (this is a much simpler feature than the original I was copying from). It is better to start small and build instead of greedily thinking all of the features will be needed.
