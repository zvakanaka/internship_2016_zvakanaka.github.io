A mentor helped me implement a [JavaScript Module Pattern](http://www.adequatelygood.com/JavaScript-Module-Pattern-In-Depth.html). Patterns are efficient and clean, but they make it hard for beginners to read the code. There are so many beginners in the JavaScript world. I want to know my stuff, so I'll try to use patterns wherever possible.
