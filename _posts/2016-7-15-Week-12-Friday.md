Worked on tests for a repo and skills training. I like skills training, because it's the kind of stuff I like to do for fun. Today was learning [Gulp](http://alferov.github.io/awesome-gulp/) by creating a gulpfile that does things automatically like minify images, JavaScript, and CSS. I love automagic things.
