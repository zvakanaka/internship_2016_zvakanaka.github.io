title: Week 11 - Saturday
---
It's Saturday! What!? Saturday? 4th of July happened, which is around the time I got lazy and did not write in this blog for the next four days. But I did learn a lot of cool stuff. I'm working on a training badge and continuing super hard stories with my fellow intern.

On Thursday, I gave a sort of [show-and-tell presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11P1KFVoSlzKxOKmk1VnVbIqktEQlYMZaYZftHfC57Ck/edit?usp=sharing) about my life at the beginning of a meeting (It's something all interns have a chance to do). After, a guy that served a couple mission in Zimbabwe was asking me about it. Then he came into my pod and asked questions about a problem with a GitHub build tool. I didn't know anything about it, but continued to look into it after he left, and eventually I solved the problem and Slacked him about it. It felt good, and I'll continue trying to make friends with people in real-life so we can trust each other in real work.

## Text Editors
Engineers here are frequently sharing exciting readings and videos. One was about [text editors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIjKJjzRX_E) and got me interested in [Vim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nim4_f5QUxA).

Looking at that chart, it perfectly describes my emacs experience - I'm constantly forgetting really cool shortcuts. So today begins the Vim adventure.

I think I will like Vim.
 - On every computer I use by default (even the chronos shell of my Chromebook)
 - Lightweight
 - Cool plugins like debugers and compilers
 - IDEs have Vim mode
